# S-AES implemented with Python
[S-AES](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/ma/holden/Archived_Courses/Math479-0304/lectures/s-aes.pdf) (simplified AES) is an simplified version of AES algorithm. A-AES is oriented for learning and education.

In this project, we give a simple implementation of S-AES encryption and decryption.
